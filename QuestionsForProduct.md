# Questions for Product Owner

### Multi Currency Support
* Can we get a definition of the explanation message to be received when a coin is rejected?

### Dispensing Change
* How do we address the situation where a customer intends to buy more than 1 item but there is insufficient change in the machine? Currently they will be unable to purchase the first item due to insufficient change.

### Contactless Payment
* If a customer leaves the machine without collecting their money using the coin return, how should this be handled? Should the next customer automatically benefit from this?
* How to choose whether to pay by Euros or Sterling when paying by card?
